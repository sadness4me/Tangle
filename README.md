Slated for a Q1 or Q2 2024 release, the mainnet launch will be accompanied by an array of community engagement activities, including hackathons, workshops, and specialized developer bootcamps. Concurrently, Tangle Network will introduce a grant program targeted specifically at fostering development in the realms of zero-knowledge and multi-party computation applications. After mainnet, on-chain governance mechanisms will be instituted, empowering the community to play an active role in pivotal decision-making processes. Each of these calculated steps aims to expedite the widespread adoption of zero-knowledge applications, solidifying Tangle Network as the preferred platform for privacy-focused decentralized applications.
