The current Tangle testnet is a standalone network, meaning that it is not connected to the Polkadot or Kusama relay chain. Since the Tangle is not a parachain, the size of nodes are quite a small build as it only contains code to run the standalone Tangle network and not syncing the relay chain or communicate between the two. As such, the build is smaller, and does not require the same minumum spec requirements as a parachain node.

The following specifications are the ideal or recommended, but nodes can be run with less. Testnet nodes have also been run using AWS t3.Large instances.
